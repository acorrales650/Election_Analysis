# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election
This project consisted of an audit and count of an election. Votes were tallied in total, by county, by percentage and a winner declared.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to efficiently sift through a large amount of votes using the tools from module 3. By declaring variables, using for loops, dictionaries, lists, the code used was able to extract the total amount of votes, categorize the results by county, calculate the percentage, determine the county with the largest turnout, and populate an external text file with that information to declare a clear winner to the clients. 

### Outcomes and Analysis
- The results of the election determined a clear winner. There were a total of 369,711 votes cast.
- Out of the three counties counted (Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe), Denver emered as the county with the largest turnout.
- Denver had a total of 306,055 votes, garnering 82.8% of the total vote
- Jefferson tallied in with 38,855 votes (10.5%) and Arapahoe had 24,801 votes (6.7%).
- The winner of the election was also very clear according to the voting totals processed.
- Diana DeGette resulted with 73.8% of the total vote and was calculated to have received 272,892 votes.
- Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes (23.0%) and Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes (3.1%).

### Election Commission Statement
The election statement code that was used to calculate these results could be easily used in larger elections and other similar contests. Executed correctly, the code supplies an efficient way to sift through the thousands of votes received. What is great about this code is if it was required to pinpoint even more specifics of the election, it could be done. If the data is present, filtering down to city or even district could be calculated. This could provide additional demographic statistics on voters.
